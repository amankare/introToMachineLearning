#Steps
#1. Register for Twitter API
#2. Install Dependencies
#3. Write our Script

#Dependency 1: Install tweepy using pip
#tweepy is our library for accessing the Twitter API

#Dependency 2: Install textblob using pip
#textblob will help us perform the actual sentiment analysis

##Script

#import tweepy. Tweepy enables Python to communicate with the Twitter platform and use it API
#textblob is a python library for processing textual data
import tweepy
from textblob import TextBlob

#the consumer key, the consumer secret key, the access token and the secret access token copied from my Twitter Developer Account
consumer_key = '37RKyXnfOKnjcmTJzfd6LZ2by'
consumer_secret = 'YilhxNGSLGlLvJNgirWr9RDbwgKdYFmaHvwLOML8Eae3yT45zQ'

access_token = '3035186966-4rfxBLAF3mRUTxGsw7vOqfcvaGAs7k8RguUlAL9'
access_token_secret = 'wPZQlwajieTU5Xnmb495jSSRNmgtkLCvnySWuhCQ5uHHK'

#create variable 'auth' for authentication using the OAuthHandler method of tweepy
from tweepy.auth import OAuthHandler
auth = OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)

#'api' is our main variable
api = tweepy.API(auth)

#store a list of tweets in 'public_tweets' with an argument
public_tweets = api.search('Ocasio')
#I do not endorse ocasio cortez in any way

#use for loop to go through every tweet
for tweet in public_tweets:
	print(tweet.text)
	analysis = TextBlob(tweet.text)
	print(analysis.sentiment)


#the results of running this code will give a value of polarity and a value of subjectivity. 
#Polarity measures how positive or negative the sentiment is.
#Subjectivity measures how opinionated or how factual it is.
#Polarity will be between -1 and 1 where towards 1 is towards positive sentiment and towards -1 is negative sentiment. 
#Subjectivity will be from 0 to 1 where 0 is very objective and 1 is very subjective.
